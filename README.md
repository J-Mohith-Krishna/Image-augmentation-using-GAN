# Image-augmentation-using-GAN
## Description-
This code loads and preprocesses images of arctic wildlife, including arctic fox, polar bear, and walrus, trains a neural network model using transfer learning with ResNet50V2, evaluates the model's performance, and visualizes the results.
## Explanation-
  -Imports: Importing necessary libraries for image processing, plotting, and data manipulation.

  -Function Definitions: Defining functions to load images from directories and display them.

  -Data Loading: Loading images and labels for training and testing from specified directories.

  -Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing images and labels for model training.

  -Model Creation: Creating a neural network model based on the ResNet50V2 architecture, including additional layers for normalization, data augmentation, and classification.

  -Model Compilation and Training: Compiling and training the model using training data, with validation during training.

  -Training Visualization: Visualizing the training process by plotting training and validation accuracy.

  -Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance using a confusion matrix.

  -Sample Prediction: Making predictions on sample images using the trained model and displaying the results.
